The Marci Metzger Homes’ updated site is a large step up in both design and technology from what we had before which is very much a focus on high quality visual flow and user experience. We see one of the main changes in the introduction of the dynamic Hero Section which also has a dark linear gradient background to improve contrast and readability of the “Find Your Sanctuary” action and also we have a very modern and floting search feature. Also we went beyond the use of standard icons in that we reimagined the Professional Services section which now uses high quality images and custom CSS object fit which in turn gives each service card a sharp and uniform look no matter the original image’s aspect ratio.

Technical we added a custom “Get It Sold” Feature Section which presents Marci’s market achievements and expertise in a standout way. We deviated from the base model this time out by including interactive “feature blocks” that use CSS transitions and hover effects to give the user a premium almost tactile experience. Also we overhauled the Photo Gallery to security in handling external URL images and we did that with precise inline styling and background size management which in turn removed rendering issues and got the display properties to look great in a high resolution grid. Also we went in to the Affiliated Partners section which we improved for better professional look and feel by way of grayscale filters and uniform container sizing which in turn put the industry logos out there with the same sharpness and visual weight. All of these improvements in addition to a mobile first design and live hosting through GitHub Pages we ended up with a very present day and authoritative digital space which does an excellent job at turning in passers by into real estate clients.
